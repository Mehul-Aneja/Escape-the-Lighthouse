    <h1>LEVEL I</h1><br>

    <p>The darkness slowly fades as a dim light emanates from the entrance of the room. An inscription above the room reads "LEVEL I"</p>
        
    <p>Eager to return to civilization, you step into the room. The room feels different, as if there is a great malicious presence 
        watching every move you make with great interest. The walls are made of stone, unlike the wooden walls of the previous rooms. There are no lanterns
        and the light seems to be coming from candles strategically circling the room. The windows have been boarded with sturdy 
        wooden planks. Shadows dance haphazardly on the walls, leaving an eery taste in your mouth. Everything has a very ritual-esque 
        feel to it.</p>
    <p>The fluid dripping from the ceiling has collected in a large puddle in the center of the room. Having no intentions of being
        sacrificed in a ritual today, you decide to leave immediately and approach the door.
